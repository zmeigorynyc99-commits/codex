# Tiny Tools

A fast, free, privacy-friendly collection of **20 browser-based utilities** —
calculators, converters, text tools, generators and developer helpers. No
accounts, no tracking by default, and every tool runs entirely in your browser.

Built to be cheap to host on a small Ubuntu VPS and friendly to organic search
traffic, with a dedicated SEO-optimised page per tool.

---

## Highlights

- **20 tools**, each on its own SEO-friendly page with a unique title,
  description, heading, explanation, worked examples and FAQ.
- **Runs in the browser** — calculations never touch a server, so the tools are
  instant and private.
- **Fast & light** — static-data-driven pages, code-split tool components, a
  ~88 kB shared JS baseline, and a container capped at 256 MB RAM.
- **SEO ready** — `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, canonical URLs, Open Graph /
  Twitter cards, and JSON-LD structured data (`WebApplication`, `FAQPage`,
  `BreadcrumbList`, `WebSite` search action).
- **Accessible** — keyboard navigation, visible focus rings, skip link, labelled
  controls, reduced-motion support, and a no-JS-friendly FAQ.
- **Dark mode** with no flash of incorrect theme.
- **Privacy-first** — no cookies, no tracking. Analytics, ads and donations are
  opt-in placeholders that render nothing until you configure them.
- **Hardened** — strict nonce-based Content-Security-Policy, full security
  header set, input-size limits, input sanitisation, and zero use of `eval` or
  unsafe HTML rendering.
- **Translation-ready** architecture (English ships today).

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** (dark mode via `class`)
- **Docker** + **Docker Compose**
- **Nginx** reverse proxy with HTTP/2, gzip, caching and rate limiting
- **Let's Encrypt** HTTPS via certbot
- **Vitest** (unit), **Playwright** (e2e), **Lighthouse CI** (performance)
- No paid APIs. The only runtime dependency beyond React/Next is `qrcode`.

Adding a tool is mostly data: add an entry to `src/lib/tools.ts`, write its pure
logic in `src/lib/tools-logic/`, add a component in `src/components/tools/`, and
register it in `src/components/tools/ToolRenderer.tsx`. Routing, the sitemap,
search, categories and structured data update automatically.

---

## One-command production setup

On a fresh Ubuntu VPS with Docker installed, from the repository root:

```bash
EMAIL=you@botera.md \
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@botera.md ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-strong-password' \
./scripts/setup.sh
```

`scripts/setup.sh` configures Nginx for the domain (`botera.md` by default,
override with `DOMAIN=`), writes `.env`, builds the image, issues a Let's
Encrypt certificate, starts the stack, and creates the admin account. Before DNS
is pointed at the server you can run it with `SKIP_CERTS=1` to use a self-signed
certificate. Full step-by-step instructions remain in **DEPLOYMENT.md**.

---

## Local development

Requires Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local      # optional: set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL etc.
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build        # production build (standalone output)
npm start            # run the production server
npm run lint         # ESLint (next/core-web-vitals)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm test             # Vitest unit tests
npm run e2e          # Playwright (builds + starts the app automatically)
npm run lighthouse   # Lighthouse CI assertions
```

---

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (see `.env.example`). Because
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time, set them before building.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Canonical/OG/sitemap base URL (no trailing slash). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_DOMAIN` / `..._SRC` | Cookie-free analytics (e.g. Plausible). Disabled when empty. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DONATE_URL` | Shows the donation button when set. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ADS` | `true` activates the (otherwise placeholder) ad slots. |
| `CMS_DB_PATH` | SQLite database file (runtime). Default `./data/cms.db`; `/app/data/cms.db` in Docker. |
| `CMS_UPLOAD_DIR` | Directory for uploaded tutorial images (runtime). Default `/app/data/uploads` in Docker. |

> **Enabling analytics or ads** loads a third-party script, so add its origin to
> the `script-src` (and `connect-src`) directives in `src/middleware.ts`,
> otherwise the strict CSP will block it.

---

## Security notes

- **Strict CSP**: `src/middleware.ts` issues a fresh nonce per request and sets
  a strict `Content-Security-Policy` (`script-src 'self' 'nonce-…'
  'strict-dynamic'`, `object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, etc.). Next
  attaches the nonce to its own scripts automatically. This is why HTML pages are
  rendered per request rather than served as fully static files — the trade-off
  required for a genuinely strict, nonce-based policy. All JS/CSS assets remain
  static and are cached aggressively by Nginx.
- **Headers**: HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` are set in `next.config.mjs`.
- **Input handling**: every free-text field enforces a maximum length
  (`src/lib/tools-logic/limits.ts`); JSON uses the native parser (never `eval`);
  no user input is ever rendered as HTML.

---

## Internationalisation

The UI is English today but structured for translation: locale config lives in
`src/lib/i18n/config.ts` and UI strings in `src/lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.ts`. To
add a language, create a new dictionary, register it in `src/lib/i18n/index.ts`,
and (optionally) introduce a `[locale]` route segment. Per-tool content can be
localised by extending the registry entries in `src/lib/tools.ts`.

---

## Linux Tutorials CMS

A self-hosted CMS for publishing Linux administration tutorials lives alongside
the tools. It adds an embedded **SQLite** database (via `better-sqlite3`), a
cookie-session **admin area**, a secure **Markdown** pipeline, and a public
tutorials section.

- **Public:** `/linux-tutorials` (listing with search, category/tag/difficulty/
  distribution filters and pagination), `/linux-tutorials/[slug]` (article with
  table of contents, reading time, badges, prev/next, related, share buttons,
  copy-able code blocks and destructive-command warnings), and an RSS feed at
  `/linux-tutorials/rss.xml`. The homepage shows a “Latest Linux Tutorials” feed.
- **Admin:** `/admin` (dashboard), `/admin/tutorials/new`, `/admin/tutorials/[id]/edit`
  (Markdown editor with live preview, autosave, image upload) and
  `/admin/tutorials/[id]/preview`. All admin pages and `/api/admin/*` routes are
  protected; drafts, previews and admin routes are excluded from search engines.

### Security model

Strict, nonce-based CSP applies site-wide. Admin sessions use scrypt-hashed
passwords and HMAC-free opaque tokens stored hashed in the database; mutations
require a CSRF double-submit token and a same-origin check. Markdown is rendered
server-side (marked → highlight.js → sanitize-html), so no user HTML or scripts
survive and **no submitted code is ever executed**. Uploads are restricted by
type and size and stored with server-generated names (no path traversal). The
login endpoint is rate-limited.

### How to create an admin account

The app migrates the database automatically on first boot. Create an admin with
the self-contained script (works on the host or inside the container):

```bash
# Docker (recommended): runs inside the running web container
docker compose exec web node scripts/create-admin.mjs admin@botera.md 'a-strong-password'

# Local development
node scripts/create-admin.mjs admin@botera.md 'a-strong-password'
```

Re-running with an existing email updates that admin’s password. Then sign in at
`/admin/login`.

### How to publish a tutorial

1. Sign in at `/admin/login` and click **New tutorial**.
2. Enter a title — the slug is generated automatically (editable; duplicates are
   prevented, and the slug stays stable if you later change the title).
3. Write the body in Markdown. Supported: headings, lists, links, tables,
   blockquotes, inline code, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting (Bash,
   Shell, YAML, JSON, Nginx, Dockerfile, Python, JavaScript, INI/config, SQL,
   diff), images, and GitHub-style callouts:

   ```markdown
   > [!WARNING]
   > This command can lock you out of the server.
   ```

   Code blocks containing destructive commands (e.g. `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd`)
   automatically get a red warning banner.
4. Set difficulty, distribution, category, tags, author and (optionally) SEO
   title/description and a cover image.
5. Use **Show preview** for a live render, or **Open preview** for the full page.
6. Click **Publish** (or save as a draft). Drafts never appear publicly, in the
   feed, the sitemap or RSS. Existing drafts autosave while you edit.

### How to manage categories and tags

- **Categories** are seeded on first boot (Getting Started, Networking, Security,
  …). Add more via the API used by the editor:
  `POST /api/admin/categories { "name": "Monitoring" }`, or remove with
  `DELETE /api/admin/categories/:id`. Assign a category per tutorial in the editor.
- **Tags** are free-form: type comma-separated tags in the editor and they are
  created automatically and de-duplicated. Tag and category pages are reachable
  via `/linux-tutorials?tag=<slug>` and `/linux-tutorials?category=<slug>`.

### How images are stored

Cover images can be either an external `https://` URL or an uploaded file.
Uploads (PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF/SVG, max 3 MB) are validated, given a random
filename and written to `CMS_UPLOAD_DIR` (default `/app/data/uploads`, on the
`cms-data` Docker volume). They are served read-only via
`/api/uploads/<file>` with caching and `nosniff`.

### How to back up tutorial content

All CMS state is the SQLite database plus the uploads directory, both on the
`cms-data` volume. Back them up with a single tarball:

```bash
# Back up the database + uploads from the volume
docker run --rm -v codex_cms-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/cms-backup-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /data .

# Restore
docker run --rm -v codex_cms-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup alpine \
  sh -c 'cd /data && tar xzf /backup/cms-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz'
```

(The volume name is `<project>_cms-data`; check `docker volume ls`.) For a quick
DB-only snapshot you can also copy the file:
`docker compose exec web sh -c 'cp /app/data/cms.db /app/data/cms-backup.db'`.

### How to deploy the database changes

Migrations live in `src/lib/cms/migrations.ts` and are applied automatically and
idempotently the first time the app opens the database after a deploy — there is
no manual migration step. To add a schema change, append a new `Migration` entry
with the next `id`; it runs on the next boot and is recorded in
`schema_migrations`. Tutorial edits keep the last 20 revisions per tutorial in
`tutorial_revisions`.
